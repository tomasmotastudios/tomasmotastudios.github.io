## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability, please do **not** create a public issue. Instead, contact the project maintainers directly:

- **Email:** [tomasmota.coffee934@silomails.com](mailto:tomasmota.coffee934@silomails.com)

Provide the following information when reporting a vulnerability:
1. Detailed description of the issue.
2. Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
3. Impact assessment (e.g., data loss, remote code execution).
4. Any relevant screenshots, logs, or code snippets.

## Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment:** The issue will be evaluated to determine severity and impact.
3. **Resolution:** We will create a fix and a patch release as soon as possible.
4. **Disclosure:** Once the issue is fixed, the reporter will be informed and the advisory published.

## Security Best Practices
- Always use the latest stable version of dependencies.
- Do not commit sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) into the repository.
- Follow secure coding practices, including input validation and proper error handling.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to avoid known vulnerabilities.

## Community Responsibilities
- Avoid sharing unverified security reports publicly.
- Respect the confidentiality of ongoing investigations.
- Provide constructive feedback when discussing security issues.
