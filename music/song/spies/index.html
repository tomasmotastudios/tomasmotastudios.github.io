      I awake to find no peace of mind
      I said, "How do you live as a fugitive down here"
      "Where I cannot see so clear?"
      I said, "What do I know?"
      "Show me the right way to go"

      And the spies came out of the water
      But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
      That the spies hide out in every corner
      But you can't touch them, no
      'Cause they're all spies

      They're all spies

      I awake to see that no one is free
      We're all fugitives, look at the way we live down here
      I cannot sleep from fear, no
      I said, "Which way do I turn?"
      Oh, I forget everything I learn

      And the spies came out of the water
      And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
      That the spies hide out in every corner
      But you can't touch them, no
      'Cause they're all spies

      They're all spies

      And if we don't hide here
      They're gonna find us
      And if we don't hide now
      They're gonna catch us where we sleep
      Ah, and if we don't hide here
      They're gonna find us

      And the spies came out of the water
      But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
      That those spies hide out in every corner
      They can't touch you, no
      'Cause they're just spies

      They're just spies

      They're just spies

      They're just spies

      They're just spies
