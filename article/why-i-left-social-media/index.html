        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In this article, I will explain in detail how and why I left social media, and how you can do the same..
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How Is Started</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            It was 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when I first accessed TikTok. At the time, it was
            amazing to be able to view content infinitely, just by scrolling endlessly. Later, Instagram, Facebook, and
            YouTube implemented their own infinite feed system, which at the time was a marvel, but I had no idea what
            was coming...
            <br>
            During the distance learning era, I was able to meet several people thanks to this tool which was social
            media, and later on, pornography. Unfortunately, all of this started to affect me and get worse around
            2023/2024, and I simply let it go... But unfortunately, thanks to the false dopamine that it brings us, I
            sank deeper and deeper, and there were times I barely slept, from always watching either short-form or adult
            content.
            <br>
            And it was in 2025 that I realized the harm that social media and pornography bring us - this also after
            having lost internship offers - due to having done such unpleasant things, which also led to my fragility,
            and then, having several people taking advantage of this, to extort money from me, to pretend to be my
            friends to take advantage of them, or to make fun of me.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How and Why I Changed</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            After suffering a lot, I came to a conclusion which was - "I have to change yesterday! It's not possible
            anymore!!"
            <br>
            During the school year transition break, I decided to erase everything abruptly so I could move on. After
            watching several videos and listening to several podcasts, I decided I also needed to change my mindset and
            change my body.
            <br>
            In early August 2025, I decided to switch to a more minimalist lifestyle with more privacy, and I switched
            from my current phone to an old phone (a dump phone in today's terms), a Nokia Lumia — which has no camera
            or internet access and is used only for calls, SMS messages, and calendar.
            <br>
            These days I live a minimalist lifestyle, without social media (I mean, I have LinkedIn, GitHub, and
            YouTube, but I only use them professionally, not personally), and without pornography, which helps me be
            much more productive. This change has also helped me do my work better, and have less stress, along with a
            clearer head (so to speak), and I've managed to lose a lot of weight.

            In short, if possible, the best option is to avoid using social media, but if absolutely necessary, we
            should use it consciously and avoid consuming short, adult content.
